    <p>Introduction</p>
    <p>Photography is definetly one of my passions and hobbies. I absolutly love photography so much. While I would love
        to continue to spew my thoughts on it, I will talk about what it is and some of the history behind it. Fist off
        to answer the question of what is photography. Well photography is the art or practice of taking and developing
        photos. The first camera was invented in 1816 by a French inventor named Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. Ever since
        then it has been evolving and continueing to grow into the thigs that we know and have today. From the first
        cameras to the phones that we have today, photography has come a very long way. While photography used to mainly
        be resurved for those that had baught a camera, now photography is accessable to nearly everyone. As long as you
        have a phone you are able to take pictures and make amazing memories.
    </p>

    <p>No matter the way that people are taking photos these days, photography is something that has always facinated
        me. I love just being able to capture a moment in time that I can look back on and remember later. There are so
        many cool photographers all throughout the world and it is amazing to see their work. For example Paul Nicklen,
        a Canadian photographer. Paul mainly focuses on nature pictures which is persoanlly what I love the most. I just
        love nature and the way it makes me feel when I am out in it. I think that Paul does a really good job at
        capturing moments that help me still help me feel that connection to nature.

        <p>Here is an interactive Tableau about photography and the price of each thing depending on where, what type of
            photography, and if it is family, groups, or idividual. While this isn't necisarily all photography prices
            it is
            similar to many of the fancier photographers.</p>

        <h5>A documentary about Photography</h5>

        <p>This is a very cool documentary about photography about Ansel Adams done by Ric Burns. This documentary
            includes many things about his Ansels life and just different things about the photography that he used.
            This documentary has images, video, and readings from Ansel's own work. In order to get a more relistic feel
            for the subject matter that they were creating this documentary about, Burns and his coworkers retraced
            Adams steps. They climbed up rocks and hiked winding trails just so that they could make the documentary as
            believable and real as possible. </p>
